3. Go to Upload option on the website <br>
4. Upload the image<br>
5. see the path of uploaded image ( Either by right click on image then copy image address OR right click, inspect the image, the URL will come in the inspect, edit it as html )</br>
6. open it (http://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi)</br>
7. See weather is that still showing exif data, if it is then Report it.
