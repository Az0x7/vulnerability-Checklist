[ ] Path Overwrite
```
If an application allows users to check their profile with direct path /{username} always try to signup with system reserved file names, such as index.php, signup.php, login.php, etc. In some cases what happens here is, when you signup with username: index.php, now upon visiting target.tld/index.php, your profile will come up and occupy the index.php page of an application. Similarly, if an attacker is able to signup with username login.php, Imagine login page getting take overed.
